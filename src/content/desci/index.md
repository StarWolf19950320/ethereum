## What is decentralized science (DeSci)?

Decentralized science (DeSci) is a movement that aims to build public infrastructure for funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and disseminating scientific knowledge fairly and equitably using the web3 stack.

The goal of DeSci is to create an ecosystem in which scientists are incentivized to openly share their research and receive credit for their work, while also providing a way for the general public to easily access and contribute to scientific research. DeSci is built on the premise that scientific knowledge should be open and accessible to everyone, and that the process of scientific research should be transparent. DeSci is also intended to create a more decentralized and distributed model for scientific research, which would make it more resistant to censorship and control by central authorities. By decentralizing access to funding, scientific tools and communication channels, DeSci hopes to create an environment where new and unconventional ideas can flourish.

Decentralized science allows for more diverse funding sources (from [DAOs](/dao), [quadratic donations](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2003531) to crowdfunding and more), easier access to data and methods, and by providing incentives for reproducibility.

## Ethereum and DeSci

A decentralized system of science will requires robust security, minimal monetary and small transaction cost, and a rich layer-2 ecosystem for application development. Ethereum provides everything needed for for building a decentralized science stack.


# DeSci use cases

DeSci is building the scientific toolstack needed to onboard Web2 academia into the digital world. Below is a sampling of use cases that Web3 can offer to the scientific community. 


## Publishing

Science publishing is famously problematic in that it is managed by publishing houses that rely upon free labor from scientists, reviewers and editors to generate the papers, but then also charge extortionate publishing fees. The public, who have usually indirectly paid for the work and the publication costs through taxation, can often not access that same work without paying the publisher again. The total costs for publishing individual science papers is often five-figures ($USD). This undermines the whole concept of scientific knowledge as a [public good](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/PublicGoods.html) while generating huge profits for a small group of publishers.


While free and open-access platforms do exist in the form of pre-print servers (e.g. ArXiv) these platforms lack quality control and [anti-sybil](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/sybil_attack) mechanisms and do not generally track article-level metrics, meaning they are usually only used to publicize work prior to submission to a traditional publisher. SciHub also exists to make published papers free to access, but not legally, and only after the publishers have already taken their payment and wrapped the work in strict copyright legislation. This leaves an important gap for accessible science papers and data that has an embedded legitimacy mechanism and incentive model. The tools for building such a system exist in Web3.


## Reproducibility and Replicability

Reproducibility and replicability are the foundations of quality scientific discovery. Findings that are reproducible can be achieved multiple times in a row by the same team using the same methodology. Findings that are replicable can be remade by a different team using the same experimental set-up. 

New primitives being created ensure that reproducibility and replicability are the basis of discovery. We can weave quality science into the technological fabric of academia. Web3 offers the ability to create attestations for each component of an analysis: the raw data, the computational engine, and the result of the application. The beauty of consensus systems is that when a trust network is created for maintaining these components, each network participant can be responsible for reproducing the calculation and validating each result.


## Funding

The current standard model for funding science is that individuals or groups of scientists make written applications to a funding agency. A small panel of trusted individuals score the applications and then interview candidates before awarding funds to a small portion of applicants. Aside from creating bottlenecks that lead to sometimes years of waiting time between applying for and receiving a grant, this model is known to be highly vulnerable to the biases, self-interests and politics of the review panel. 

Studies have shown that grant review panels do a poor job of selecting high quality projects. The same proposals given to different panels have wildly different outcomes. As funding has become more scarce it has concentrated into a smaller pool of more senior researchers with more intellectually conservative projects. The effect has been to create a hyper-competitive funding landscape, entrenching perverse incentive and stifling innovation. 

Web3 has the potential to disrupt this broken funding model by experimenting with different incentive models developed by DAOs and web3 broadly. [Retroactive public goods funding](https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c), [quadratic funding](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2003531), [DAO governance](https://www.antler.co/blog/daos-and-web3-governance) and [tokenized incentive structures](https://cdixon.org/2017/05/27/crypto-tokens-a-breakthrough-in-open-network-design) are some of the web3 tools that could revolutionize science funding.


## IP Ownership and Development

Intellectual property (IP) is a big problem in traditional science. From being stuck in universities or unused in biotechs, to being notoriously hard to value. However, ownership of digital assets (such as scientific data or articles) is something Web3 does exceptionally well using [NFTs](/nft).

The same way that NFTs can pass revenue for future transactions back to the original creator, you can establish transparent value attribution chains to reward researchers, governing bodies (like DAOs), or even the subjects whose data is collected. 

IP-NFTs can also function as a key to a decentralized data repository of the research experiments being undertaken, and plug into NFT and [DeFi](/defi) financialization (from fractionalization to lending pools and value appraisal). It also allows for natively onchain entities such as DAOs like [VitaDAO](https://www.vitadao.com/) to hold research directly on-chain. 
The advent of non-transferable ["soulbound"](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html) tokens may also play an important role in DeSci by allowing individuals to prove their experience and credentials linked to their Ethereum address.

## Data Storage, Access and Architecture

Scientific data can be made vastly more accessible using Web3 patterns, and distributed storage will enable research to survive cataclysmic events. 

The starting point must be a system that can be accessed by any decentralized identity holding the right verifiable credentials. This allows sensitive data to be securely replicated by trusted parties, enabling redundancy and censorship resistance, reproduction of results, and even the ability for multiple parties to collaborate and add new data to the dataset. Confidential computing methods like [compute-to-data](https://7wdata.be/predictive-analytics/compute-to-data-using-blockchain-to-decentralize-data-science-and-ai-with-the-ocean-protocol) provide alternative access mechanisms to raw data replication, creating Trusted Research Environments for the most sensitive data. 

Flexible Web3 data solutions support the scenarios above in addition to providing the foundation for truly Open Science, where public goods can be created that have no access permissions and no fees. Web3 Public Data solutions such as IPFS, Arweave and Filecoin are optimized for decentralization. dClimate, for example, provides universal access to climate and weather data, including from weather stations and predictive climate models.
