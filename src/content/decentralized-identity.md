# What are identity, identifiers and attestations? {#what-are-identity-identifiers-attestations}

## What is identity {#what-is-identity}

Identity means an individual's sense of self, defined by a set of unique characteristics. Identity refers to the fact of being an _individual_, i.e., a distinct human entity. Identity could also refer to other non-human entities, such as an organization or authority.

## What are identifiers? {#what-are-identifiers}

An identifier is a piece of information that can be used to distinguish a person's identity. Common identifiers include the following: 
- Name
- Social security number/tax ID number 
- Mobile number 
- Date and place of birth
- Digital identification credentials, e.g., passwords, email address, usernames

## What are attestations? {#what-are-attestations}
 
An attestation refers to a claim made by an entity about another entity. An example attestation is a driver's license issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The driver's license, which proves a specific claim (that the holder has legal permission to drive a car) is made by one entity (the DMV) about another entity (Bob, the driver). 

Although attestations and identities are different, an attestation contains identifiers that point to an individual's identity. The driver's license mentioned earlier, for example, may have identifiers, like the holder’s name, date of birth, and nationality. 

## What are decentralized identifiers? {#what-are-decentralized-identifiers}

Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are identifiers that are not issued, managed, or controlled by a central authority. Traditional identifiers, like an email address or mobile number, are reliant on intermediaries—email providers, mobile network operators, and so on. 

Decentralized identifiers are issued, held, and controlled by individuals. An [Ethereum account](/developers/docs/accounts/), for example, is a decentralized identifier. Anyone can create an account, set up a wallet, and validate their identity on the Ethereum network. 

DIDs are stored on distributed ledgers (blockchains) or peer-to-peer networks. This makes DIDs [globally unique, resolvable with high availability, and cryptographically verifiable](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-primer/). A DID can be associated with different entities, including people, organizations, or government institutions.  

## What makes this possible? {what-makes-decentralized-identifiers-possible} 

### 1. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) {#public-key-infrastructure} 

Public-key infrastructure (PKI) is an information security measure that generates a [public key](/glossary/#public-key) and [private key](/glossary/#private-key) for an entity. Public-key cryptography is used in blockchain networks to authenticate user identities and prove ownership of digital assets. 

A DID, like an Ethereum account, will have a private key and a public key. While the private key is used for encrypting and signing messages, the public key authenticates the identity of the entity controlling a DID. PKI provides proofs needed to authenticate entities and prevent impersonation and use of fake identities.

### 2. Decentralized datastores {#decentralized-datastores}

A blockchain serves as a verifiable data registry; an open, trustless, and decentralized repository of information. The existence of public blockchains, like Ethereum, eliminates the need to store identifiers in centralized registries. 

If anyone needs to confirm the validity of a DID, they can look up the associated public key on the blockchain. This is different from traditional identifiers that can only be authenticated by third parties. 

## How do decentralized identifiers and attestations enable decentralized identity? {#how-decentralized-identifiers-and-attestations-enable-decentralized-identity} 

Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and attestations are the major building blocks of decentralized identity. Decentralized identity or self-sovereign identity is the idea that identity-related information should be self-controlled, private, and portable. 

In the context of decentralized identity, attestations (also known as [Verifiable Credentials](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/)) are tamper-proof, cryptographically verifiable claims made by the issuer. Every attestation or Verifiable Credential an entity (e.g., an organization) issues is associated with their DID. 

Because DIDs are stored on the blockchain, anyone can verify the validity of an attestation by cross-checking the issuer's DID on Ethereum. Essentially, the Ethereum blockchain acts like a global directory that enables the verification of DIDs associated with certain entities.

Decentralized identifiers are the reason attestations are self-controlled and verifiable. Even if the issuer doesn't exist anymore, the holder always has proof of the attestation's provenance and validity. 

DIDs are also crucial to the goal of protect the privacy of personal information through decentralized identity. For instance, if an individual submits proof of an attestation (a driver's license), the verifying party doesn't need to check the validity of information in the proof. The verifier only needs cryptographic guarantees of the attestation's authenticity and the identity of the issuing organization to determine if the proof is valid. 

## Types of attestations in decentralized identity {#types-of-attestations-in-decentralized-identity}

How attestation information is stored and retrieved in an Ethereum-based identity ecosystem is different from traditional identity management. Here is an overview of the various approaches to issuing, storing, and verifying attestations in decentralized identity systems: 

### Off-chain attestations {#off-chain-attestations}

A major concern with storing attestations on-chain is that they contain personally identifiable information (PII) that individuals want to keep private. The transparent nature of the Ethereum blockchain, therefore, makes it unattractive for storing attestations. 

The solution is to issue attestations, held by users off-chain in digital wallets, but signed with the issuer's DID stored on-chain. These attestations are encoded as [JSON Web Tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON_Web_Token) and contain the issuer's digital signature—which allows for easy verification of off-chain claims.

Here's an hypothetical scenario to explain off-chain attestations:

1. A university (the issuer) generates an attestation (a digital academic certificate), signs with its keys, and issues it to Bob (the identity owner). 

2. Bob applies for a job and wants to prove his academic qualifications to an  employer, so he shares the attestation from his mobile wallet. The company (the verifier) can then confirm the validity of the attestation by checking the issuer's DID (i.e., its public key on Ethereum). 

### Off-chain attestations with persistent access {#offchain-attestations-with-persistent-access}

Under this arrangement attestations are transformed into JSON files and stored off-chain (ideally on a [decentralized cloud storage](/developers/docs/storage/) platform, such as IPFS or Swarm). However, a hash of the JSON file is stored on-chain and linked to a DID via an on-chain registry. The associated DID could either be that of the issuer of the attestation or the recipient. 

This approach enables attestations to gain blockchain-based persistence, while keeping claims information encrypted and verifiable. It also allows for selective disclosure since the holder of the private key can decrypt the information. 

### On-chain attestations {#onchain-attestations}

On-chain attestations are held in [smart contracts](/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract (acting as a registry in this case) will map an attestation to a corresponding on-chain DID (i.e., a public key). 

Here's an example to show on-chain attestations might work in practice:

1. A company (XYZ Corp.) plans to sell ownership shares using a smart contract, but only wants buyers that have completed a background check.

2. XYZ Corp. can have the company handling the background checks issue on-chain attestations on Ethereum. This attestation certifies that an individual (represented by a DID) has completed the check, but doesn't expose any personal information. 

3. The smart contract handling the sales of shares can call the registry contract for identities of screened buyers. This makes it possible for the smart contract to determine who is permitted to buy shares or not. 

## Benefits of decentralized identity {#benefits-of-decentralized-identity} 

1. Decentralized identity increases increases individual control of identifying information. Decentralized identifiers and attestations can be verified without relying on centralized authorities and third-party services. 

2. Decentralized identity solutions facilitates a trustless, seamless, and privacy-protecting method for verifying and managing user identity. 

3. Decentralized identity harnesses blockchain technology, which creates trust between different parties and provides cryptographic guarantees to prove the validity of attestations.

4. Decentralized identity makes identity data portable. Users store attestations and identifiers in mobile wallet and can share with any party of their choice. Decentralized identifiers and attestations are not locked into the database of the issuing organization. 

## Decentralized identity use-cases {#decentralized-identity-use-cases}

Decentralized identity has many potential use-cases:

### 1. Universal dApp logins {#universal-dapp-logins} 
[Decentralized applications](/dapps/) can issue attestations to users, which can be stored in an Ethereum wallet. An attestation in this case could be an an [NFT](/nft/) granting the holder access to an online community. 

A [Sign-In With Ethereum](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361) function would then enable servers to confirm the user's Ethereum account and fetch the required attestation from their account address. This means users can access the dapp without inputting passwords or sharing personal information.  

### 2. KYC Authentication {#kyc-authentication}
Using many online services requires individuals to provide attestations and credentials, such as a driving license or national passport. But this approach is problematic because private user information can be compromised and service providers cannot verify the authenticity of the attestation. 

Decentralized identity allows companies to skip on conventional Know-Your-Customer (KYC) processes and authenticate user identities via Verifiable Credentials. This reduces the cost of identity management and prevents the use of fake documentation. 

### 3. Voting and online communities {#voting-and-online-communities}

Online voting and social media are two novel applications for decentralized identity. Online voting schemes are susceptible to manipulation, especially if malicious actors create false identities to vote. Asking individuals to present on-chain attestations can improve the integrity of online voting processes. 

Decentralized identity can enable the creation of online communities that are free of fake accounts. Each user must authenticate their identity using an on-chain identity system, like the Ethereum Name Service, reducing the possibility of bots overrunning social platforms. 

## Use decentralized identity applications on Ethereum

There are also many ambitious projects using Ethereum as a foundation for decentralized identity solutions:

- [Website](https://ens.domains/)

**SpruceID - _A decentralized identity project which allows users to control digital identity with Ethereum accounts and ENS profiles instead of relying on third-party services._** 
- [Website](https://www.spruceid.com/)

**Proof of Humanity - _Proof of Humanity (or PoH) is a social identity verification system built on Ethereum._**
- [Website](https://www.proofofhumanity.id/)

**BrightID - _A decentralized, open-source social identity network seeking to reform identity verification through the creation and analysis of a social graph._**
