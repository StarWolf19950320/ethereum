## What is decentralized science (DeSci)?

Decentralized science (DeSci) is a movement that aims to build public infrastructure for funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and disseminating scientific knowledge fairly and equitably using the web3 stack.

The goal of DeSci is to create an ecosystem in which scientists are incentivized to openly share their research and receive credit for their work, while also providing a way for the general public to easily access and contribute to scientific research. DeSci is built on the premise that scientific knowledge should be open and accessible to everyone, and that the process of scientific research should be transparent. DeSci is also intended to create a more decentralized and distributed model for scientific research, which would make it more resistant to censorship and control by central authorities. By decentralizing access to funding, scientific tools and communication channels, DeSci hopes to create an environment where new and unconventional ideas can flourish.

## The problems in science

Science has been failing to keep up with the demands of the modern world for centuries. The mechanisms that have governed scientific inquiry for centuries are no longer providing all the necessary advancements needed in medicine, energy production, materials, exploration, mathematics, and other areas of scientific development. 

This is due in part to the gatekeeping of knowledge and resources by third party arbiters, as well as the inability of the general public to participate in and understand the scientific process. 

Decentralized science can help to address these issues by allowing for more diverse funding sources (from DAOs, quadratic donations to crowdfunding and more), easier access to data and methods, and by providing incentives for reproducibility.

​​


## Why we need science

Science is a process that allows us to create and translate knowledge in order to improve the quality of life for humanity as a whole. It also provides solutions to some of the most complex problems we face. In order to be trustworthy, knowledge produced by science must be replicable and open to scrutiny. This process should be impartial and available to the public. Any knowledge that cannot be replicated or tested for falsifiability should not be considered as the truth.

By creating knowledge that is impartial and available to the public, we enable ourselves to make fundamental technological advancements. These advancements give us the power to more effectively navigate and manipulate our environment, leading to vast improvements in quality of life. As we continue to create impartial knowledge and make technological advancements, we find ourselves capable of managing increasingly complex systems. Today, we are confronted with species-level existential risks, such as climate change and global pandemics. Science is the only process we have that offers equitable positive outcomes.


## How DeSci improves science

**List of key problems in science and how decentralized science can help to address these issues**



* bureaucratic funding structures -> allow for more diverse funding sources (quadratic donations, DAOs, crowdfunding etc.) 
* replication crisis -> allowing for easier access to data and methods, and by providing incentives for reproducibility.
* misaligned incentives -> aligning incentives more closely with the goals of science. 
* poor data quality -> incentivising transparent data sharing and quality control. 
* [publication bias](https://forrt.org/glossary/publication-bias-file-drawer-proble/) -> enabling publication in a wider range of outlets. 
* [p-hacking](https://www.methodspace.com/blog/primer-p-hacking) -> incentivising transparent and honest reporting of results.
* [cherry picking](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33999541/) -> requiring publication of all results, including negative or inconclusive ones. 
* [HARKing](https://forrt.org/glossary/harking/): hypothesizing after the results are known -> providing incentives for transparent and honest reporting of results.

## Ethereum and DeSci

Ethereum provides the right foundation for building a decentralized science stack because it is a security and decentralization champion. 

Only Ethereum has the level of security and also a (nearly) Turing-complete virtual machine that supports a rich application layer. DeSci will thrive on Ethereum Layer-2s, where costs and transaction times are very low but security is inherited from Ethereum. A decentralized system of science will require robust security, minimal monetary and temporal transaction cost, and a rich layer-2 ecosystem for application development. Ethereum provides this foundation on which DeSci can thrive.


# Why Web3 needs DeSci


## Adoption

Decentralized science has the potential to attract new participants and contributors to web3 and to help disseminate knowledge more effectively.

The web3 community is still in its early stages, and there is a lot of work to be done in order to realize the full potential of decentralized science. However, the potential benefits are significant, and it is worth exploring how decentralized science can be used to improve the way we conduct research and share knowledge.

**Participants in Web3**

The tools DeSci produces are easy to understand and can be explained without using technical jargon. For example, research objects are scientific papers that contain more information than a simple PDF. Imagine being able to interact with a research paper instead of just reading it. Imagine being able to see the code used to run simulations and running it yourself with a simple click of a button. Imagine being able to see every change, evolution, and contributor to the research over its lifetime, just like with Git. 

Publishing networks allow research to be published, reviewed, elevated, and replicated without input from a controlling authority or company. Imagine never having to pay to access a research object. Imagine researchers getting paid directly for their work instead of through an intermediary. Imagine a marketplace of people and entities that provide review, curation, and replication services, instead of an oligopoly of a few major conglomerates.

**Contributors to Web3**

The people and institutions who have been brought on board through DeSci's tooling have a lot of experience and knowledge in different areas. They've been working on similar problems to those facing Web3 for a long time. DeSci is making tools that will make their lives easier and let them keep working on the hardest and most rewarding problems facing society.  Having economists and mathematicians, to social psychologists and historians, with centuries of knowledge from hundreds of thousands of academics can help build the foundation of the macro-systems we're trying to create. In doing this, we're inviting them into the trustless world to keep doing what they're good at: solving the most challenging and fulfilling problems society has to offer.


## Innovation

The systems of decentralized science require new ways of funding, creating, reviewing, crediting, storing, and disseminating knowledge. These new methods are applied to science but can be used for other purposes as well. From rich on-chain research objects to IP-NFTs and everything in between, the development happening in DeSci will be pivotal to the digital world moving forward. The Cambrian explosion of projects and concepts since inception creates an environment of rapid experimentation where anything is possible.


## Legitimacy

The crypto world is threatened by the possibility of extreme regulation. Web3 needs examples of blockchain use-cases that are easily understood and palatable, demonstrating a capability to increase efficiency, efficacy, reliability, and public trust of critical systems. DeSci is perhaps the best positioned to develop these examples..


## Scalable knowledge creation

Current research on Web3 is conducted in a way that is not efficient or effective in producing reliable information. The scientific method is a much better way to distill knowledge, and academia is trained in using this method. DeSci is creating the tool stack needed to apply the scientific method to research on Web3.


# DeSci use cases

DeSci is building the scientific toolstack needed to onboard Web2 academia into the digital world. Below is a sampling of use cases that Web3 can offer to the scientific community. 


## Publishing

Science publishing is famously problematic in that it is managed by publishing houses that rely upon free labor from scientists, reviewers and editors to generate the papers, but then also charge extortionate publishing fees. The public, who have usually indirectly paid for the work and the publication costs through taxation, can often not access that same work without paying the publisher again. The total costs for publishing individual science papers is often five-figures ($USD). This undermines the whole concept of scientific knowledge as a public good while generating huge profits for a small group of publishers.

Censorship resistance probably needs to be added

While free and open-access platforms do exist in the form of pre-print servers (e.g. ArXiv) these platforms lack quality control and anti-sybil mechanisms and do not generally track article-level metrics, meaning they are usually only used to publicize work prior to submission to a traditional publisher. SciHub also exists to make published papers free to access, but not legally, and only after the publishers have already taken their payment and wrapped the work in strict copyright legislation. This leaves an important gap for accessible science papers and data that has an embedded legitimacy mechanism and incentive model. The tools for building such a system exist in Web3.


## Reproducibility and Replicability

Reproducibility and replicability are the foundations of quality scientific discovery. Findings that are reproducible can be achieved multiple times in a row by the same team using the same methodology. Findings that are replicable can be remade by a different team using the same experimental set-up. 

New primitives being created ensure that reproducibility and replicability are the basis of discovery. We can weave quality science into the technological fabric of academia. Web3 offers the ability to create attestations for each component of an analysis: the raw data, the computational engine, and the result of the application. The beauty of consensus systems is that when a trust network is created for maintaining these components, each network participant can be responsible for reproducing the calculation and validating each result.


## Funding

The current standard model for funding science is that individuals or groups of scientists make written applications to a funding agency. A small panel of trusted individuals score the applications and then interview candidates before awarding funds to a small portion of applicants. Aside from creating bottlenecks that lead to sometimes years of waiting time between applying for and receiving a grant, this model is known to be highly vulnerable to the biases, self-interests and politics of the review panel. 

Studies have shown that grant review panels do a poor job of selecting high quality projects. The same proposals given to different panels have wildly different outcomes. As funding has become more scarce it has concentrated into a smaller pool of more senior researchers with more intellectually conservative projects. The effect has been to create a hyper-competitive funding landscape, entrenching perverse incentive and stifling innovation. 

Web3 has the potential to disrupt this broken funding model by experimenting with different incentive models developed by DAOs and web3 broadly. Retroactive public goods funding, quadratic voting and donating, DAO governance, tokenized incentive structures are some of the web3 tools that could revolutionize science funding.


## IP Ownership and Development

Intellectual property (IP) is a big problem in traditional science. From being stuck in universities or unused in biotechs, to being notoriously hard to value. However, ownership of digital assets (such as scientific data or articles) is something Web3 does exceptionally well using NFTs.

The same way that NFTs can pass revenue for future transactions back to the original creator, you can establish transparent value attribution chains to reward researchers, governing bodies (like DAOs), or even the subjects whose data is collected. 

IP-NFTs can also function as a key to a decentralized data repository of the research experiments being undertaken, and plug into NFT and DeFi financialization (from fractionalization to lending pools and value appraisal). It also allows for natively onchain entities such as DAOs like VitaDAO to hold research directly on-chain. 


## Data Storage, Access and Architecture

Scientific data can be made vastly more accessible using Web3 patterns, and distributed storage will enable research to survive cataclysmic events. 

The starting point must be a system that can function without a human in the loop, where instead of key resources being gated by email validation or expensive corporate subscriptions, access can be granted to any decentralized identity holding the right verifiable credentials. This allows sensitive data to be securely replicated by trusted parties, enabling redundancy and censorship resistance, the reproduction of results, and even the ability for multiple parties to collaborate and add new data to the dataset. Confidential computing methods like compute-to-data provide alternative access mechanisms to raw data replication, creating Trusted Research Environments for the most sensitive data. 

Flexible Web3 data solutions support the scenarios above in addition to providing the foundation for truly Open Science, where public goods can be created that have no access permissions and no fees. Web3 Public Data solutions such as IPFS, Arweave and Filecoin are optimized for decentralization. dClimate, for example, provides universal access to climate and weather data, including from weather stations and predictive climate models.
