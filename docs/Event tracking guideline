# Event Tracking Guide
This is a guide how to strategically prepare event tracking when creating a new page.

Events are good to measure user engagement on the website. We create custom reports in Matomo to view events of specific URL. Events ashould be grouped by specific topic + position on the page. (Ex: L2 page external links, selected bridge, selected cex)

You can track virtually any website element with event tracking, including:
- clicks
- downloads
- Popup viewed
- Form field abandons
- Scrolling down a page


# Each event comprises of 4 hiearchical values:

 1. Category (other events may share the same category if one feature has several actions)
 2. Action
 3. Label (optional)
 4. Value (optional, can be number or text)
 
 
## Category
Please consider the page visual context when deciding which events should be grouped together (under the same category). Ideally, all events related to one feature should be grouped together under the same category only if there is a single position on the page where the event can be triggered. 

Example:
Find wallets page redirects to external links (wallets) in two positions: A) through the main list of wallets B) Through a modal window with detailed info about a specific wallet. In this case we would like to have 2 separate categories for external links instead of one:

- Matomo list view
    - Category: WalletExternalLinkList
    - Action: Go to wallet
    - eventName: walletname + list position
    - Value: position
- Matomo modal view
    - Category: WalletExternalLinkModal
    - Action: Go to wallet
    - eventName: `${WalletName}: ${url} ` -> MetaMask: https://metamask.io
    - Value: position
    
Such division allows to specifically identify where user clicked on the page, if all external links were under one category "ExternalLink", we would not be able to measure the performance difference between the list and the modal window.
    
## Hidden gem of tracking: Value
Can be used to get more info on the UX. 

- Use it to track the average position of clicked search result 
- What terms are entered into search field
- Which option is chosen from a dropdown menu
- How many or what filters are applied when filtering list of wallets
