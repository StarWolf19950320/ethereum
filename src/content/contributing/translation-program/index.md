## About the Translation Program {#about-us}

The Ethereum community aims to be global and inclusive, yet much of its content only caters to English speakers, leaving out the world's 6 billion non-English speakers. For ethereum.org to act as the portal into Ethereum for the worldwide community, we believe providing non-English speakers with Ethereum content in their native languages is essential.

The ethereum.org Translation Program aims to make Ethereum accessible to everyone by translating ethereum.org and other Ethereum content into as many languages as possible.

## Starting your own translation program {#starting-a-translation-program}

We are dedicated to translating Ethereum content into as many languages as possible and making educational content available to everyone.
In line with our focus on translations, we want to help other Ethereum projects organize, manage, and improve their own translation efforts.

For this reason, we have created a [Translation Program playbook](/contributing/translation-program/playbook/) that contains some tips and best practices we have picked up in the process of translating ethereum.org.

Want to collaborate further or use some of our translation resources? Have any feedback on the playbook? We would love to hear from you at translations@ethereum.org.
