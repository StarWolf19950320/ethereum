# EF blog translations {#blog-translations}

The [Ethereum Foundation blog](https://blog.ethereum.org/) is the primary publication tool for a lot of EF-supported teams. Several teams regularly use the blog to publish announcements, updates, reports, roundups, and other public communication.

In line with some key values from the ethereum.org Translation Program mission and vision, [ethereum.org Translation Program mission and vision](/contributing/translation-program/mission-and-vision) - accessibility, inclusivity, empowerment, and building the global Ethereum community - we want to translate the Ethereum Foundation blog posts in as many languages as possible.

The blog translation project is open and anyone can contribute.
If you want to get involved and help translate blog posts into your language, read on to learn how to join the project in Crowdin and start translating.

## How to translate {#how-to-translate}

<InfoBanner shouldCenter emoji=":light_bulb:">
  We encourage you to check out the ethereum.org Translation style guide. It contains some of the most important guidelines, instructions, and tips for translators to help localize the blog. While originally written for ethereum.org translators, most of the style guide is relevant to blog translations as well.

1. **[Join the blog translations project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereum-foundation-blog)**  
   You will need to log in to your Crowdin account or sign up if you don’t already have one. All that is required to sign up is an e-mail account and password.

2. **Open the language you want to translate and find a blog post to work on**  
   Each blog post is uploaded to Crowdin as an individual file. The files are named after the blog post title, so finding a specific post that you want to translate should be fairly straightforward. You can check the progress of each document on the right – if translation progress is below 100%, please contribute!

   After selecting the file you want to translate, it will open in the online editor. If you have never used Crowdin before, you can use this quick guide to go over the basics.
