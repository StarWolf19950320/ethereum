## What is decentralized science (DeSci)?

Decentralized science (DeSci) is a movement that recognizes scientific knowledge as a public good and aims to build an infrastructure for funding, creating, storing and disseminating scientific knowledge fairly and equitably using the Web3 stack.

## Why do we need DeSci?

Science is the process of discovering new truths about the world. These truths power the technological advancements that allow us to navigate and manipulate our environment more skillfully over time. Scientific knowledge is fundamental to managing and mitigating species-level existential risks such as climate change or pandemics, and also enables human quality of life to improve over time. Strong economic, ethical and pragmatic arguments can be made in favour of scientific knowledge being a public good. However, the current infrastructure for funding and doing scientific work is not fit for purpose. The reasons for this are diverse but ultimately arise as a consequence of centralized control.

### Publishing

Science publishing is famously problematic in that it is managed by publishing houses that rely upon free labour from scientists, reviewers and editors to generate the papers, but then also charge extortionate publishing fees. The public, who have usually indirectly paid for the work and the publication costs through taxation, can often not access that same work without paying the publisher again. The total costs for publishing individual science papers is often five-figures ($USD). This undermines the whole concept of scientific knowledge as a public good while generating huge profits for a small group of publishers.

While free and open-access platforms do exist in the form of pre-print servers (e.g. ArXiv) these platforms lack quality control and anti-sybil mechanisms and do not generally track article-level metrics, meaning they are usually only used to publicize work prior to submission to a traditional publisher. SciHub also exists to make published papers free to access, but not legally, and only after the publishers have already taken their payment and wrapped the work in strict copyright legislation. This leaves an important gap for accessible science papers and data that has an embedded legitimacy mechanism and incentive model. The tools for buildign such a system exist in Web3.

### Funding

The standard model for fundign science is that individuals or groups of scientists make written applications to a funding agency. A small panel of trusted individuals scire the applications and then interview candidates before awarding funds to some of them. This model is known to be highly vulnerable to the biases, self-interests and politics of the review panel. Studes have shown that grant review panels do a poor job of selecting high quality projects. The same proposals given to different panels have wildly different outcomes. As funding has become more scarce it has concentrated into a smaller pool of more senior researchers with more intellectually conservative projects. The effect has been to create a hyper-competitive funding landscape, entrenching perverse incentive and stifling innovation. Web3 has the potential to disrupt this broken funding model by adapting incentive models developed by DAOs and dapps. Retroactive public goods funding, quadratic voting, airdrops and tokenized incentive structures are Web3 staples that could revolutionize science funding.

### IP ownership

Intellectual property is a problem in TradSci. However, ownership of digital assets (such as scientific data or articles) is something Web3 does exceptionally using NFTs.

### Data storage

Scientific data must be universally available and not hidden away behind paywalls. It must also be out of centralized control and able to survive cataclysmic events. Web3 file storage solutions such as IPFS, Arweave and Filecoin meet these requirements much better than traditional private servers. dClimate, for example, provides univbersal access to climate and weather data, including from weather stations and predictyive climate models.

## Ethereum and DeSci

Ethereum is the right foundation for building as DeSci stack because it is a security and decentralization champion. The canon of scientific knowledge is too valuable for compromises in the decentralization and security of the base layer to be acceptable - it must be able to survive cataclysms and resist diverse attacks from external agents. Only Ethereum has this level of security and also a (nearly) Turing-complete virtual machine that supports a rich application layer. It seems logical that DeSci will thrive on Ethereum Layer-2, where costs and transaction times are very low but security is inherited from Ethereum.
